passage: Generally, amnesty is defined as any governmental pardon for past offenses or crimes, especially political ones. Granting amnesty goes beyond a pardon, in that it forgives the said offense completely, and typically without consequences. For purposes of conservative politics, amnesty is a political term typically associated with two major issues -- immigration and capital punishment. As it relates to immigration, amnesty is the term used for granting automatic citizenship to resident aliens, who are in the United States illegally. Amnesty for illegal immigrants is the subject of tremendous controversy since it essentially bypasses the citizenship and assimilation process essential to all legal immigration into the United States.

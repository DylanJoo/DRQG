There are many different types of roaches throughout the world, based on the regions they dwell in. Cockroaches can inhabit inside the home, outside the home, or both. If a roach prefers to dwell outside it is called a feral roach.The feral roaches still may end up inside the home but their survival is independent of humans. Next are the peridomestic roaches that can survive inside or outside the home.his small family of roaches is commonly referred to as Sand Cockroaches. There are only a few described genera with around 100 to 150 species. The genera of the Arenivaga have evolved a system of absorbing moisture through the environment.

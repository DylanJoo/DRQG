passage: Adrenaline is one of the body's most important stress chemicals. It is secreted from the adrenal glands, which sit atop each kidney. Adrenaline also plays a key role as a neurotransmitter that facilitates communication between brain cells, or neurons, and other cells.

Adrenaline rushes can be healthy responses to actual threats to a person's well-being or symptoms of an underlying mental disorder.

passage: Generally, amnesty is defined as any governmental pardon for past offenses or crimes, especially political ones. Granting amnesty goes beyond a pardon, in that it forgives the said offense completely, and typically without consequences. For purposes of conservative politics, amnesty is a political term typically associated with two major issues -- immigration and capital punishment. As it relates to immigration, amnesty is the term used for granting automatic citizenship to resident aliens, who are in the United States illegally. Amnesty for illegal immigrants is the subject of tremendous controversy since it essentially bypasses the citizenship and assimilation process essential to all legal immigration into the United States.

passage: Combined with other minerals, aluminum is found in the kitchen of almost every home. All the cans that contain your sodas and juices are made of aluminum, so are a few of the TV trays used for frozen meals. You may use aluminum to cook your food, since there are pots and pans made from aluminum. In addition, do not forget the easiest and most used thing in your kitchen that is made of aluminum, foil. Foil used to be made out of tin, but tin leaves a metal taste on food, so aluminum replaced tin as the household foil in 1910.

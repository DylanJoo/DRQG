Passage:  How many gallons are in a cubic meter? Gallons and Cubic Meters. If you have ever bought or seen a gallon jug of water, you are familiar with what a gallon looks like in the real world. However, most of us are not familiar with what a cubic meter looks like in the real world. Thankfully, we have a conversion fact that relates gallons and cubic meters that tells us how many gallons are in a cubic meter and allows us to convert between the two measurements. Answer and Explanation: There are approximately 264.172052 gallons in 1 cubic meter giving the following conversion fact. 1 cubic meter â 264.172052 gallons We can use this fact to convert a measurement given in cubic meters to gallons so that we can better picture the measurement since most of us are more familiar with gallons than with cubic meters.

Passage:  The surface area, water quality, and size of fish stocked determine the number of trout a pond will support. A pond will support more little fish than big fish. The standard fall stocking rate is 400 to 500 2-4â fingerlings per acre. This stocking rate may result in 8-9â trout the first year. pond stocked in fall with 2-4â trout will produce many small but usable trout the first year. If you fish these small fish lightly, you may catch some trout weighing 1Â½ to 2 pounds (15-16â) during the second year. Waiting another year or two for a 2-pound trout to grow larger may not be worthwhile.

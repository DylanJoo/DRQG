However, most of us are not familiar with what a cubic meter looks like in the real world. Thankfully, we have a conversion fact that relates gallons and cubic meters that tells us how many gallons are in a cubic meter and allows us to convert between the two measurements. Answer and Explanation: There are approximately 264.172052 gallons in 1 cubic meter giving the following conversion fact. 1 cubic meter â 264.172052 gallons We can use this fact to convert a measurement given in cubic meters to gallons so that we can better picture the measurement since most of us are more familiar with gallons than with cubic meters.
